# dev log

What if this was an htmx app?
We have all the data pretty much setup, but we need a fair bit of logic. 
If htmx needs apis to call, which we can setup, it can even be a web worker
So, if this is api based, we'll need to store characters on the server. 


## Goals
I would like to be able to see lifepaths as I add them. Preview, and or, list existing.
I would also like to be able to adjust most things about the character so I can also use it to create character sheets for manually entered characters. Ie, turn a skill gray shade, add multiple cash dice, add custom character traits.
I would like traits that add free things to be represented, as well as wife style lifepaths (that one could be tricky)
may be something more like dnd beyond

That is verging towards burning wheel in foundry. 

for the fun, we'll use gun and svelte.
